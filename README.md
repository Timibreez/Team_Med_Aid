As stated above this mobile application is built using flutter.

firebase has been used as the backend

App Function include:
  signing up as a doctor with a special private token generated from the firebase database
    registered doctors are allowed to add photos of unrecognized accident victims and names were applicable, with a status.(deceased or in recovery).
    registered doctors have profiles 
    registered doctors can upload onCall days and specialty in case of instant location during serious cases
  the general public can just access the mobile application to;
    view or search for missing loved ones, in case they arent missing per say, and are just in a health care due to an accident and unidentified.
    the general public or first responders of accident cases can quickly search for health care provider specialty in a case were an accident has occured, and can access health care providers on call for that day and closest location.
    
 This app attempts to save more lifes, that are normally lost due to time constraints in locating specialist for certain incidents.
 and tends to save time and resources in finding of said missing persons.
